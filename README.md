## Introduction
> [!TIP]
> In the course of my work and personal projects, I have developed numerous Bash scripts to address a variety of needs. This repository serves as a central hub for these scripts, making them accessible to anyone who might find them useful. If you are looking to automate routine tasks, you will likely find a script here that suits your needs.



## Disclaimer
> [!CAUTION]
> Use these scripts at your own risk! While I have tested and used these scripts on my own systems without issue, I cannot guarantee that they will work perfectly on every setup. By using these scripts, you acknowledge that I am not responsible if your computer turns into a potato, your files vanish into the ether, or Python decides to purge from your system. Always review the script code before running it. Happy scripting!
